# About: #
This python script parses through data in a text file with an entire season of Cardinals Baseball box scores in 1940. It states the number of times a player batted, the player's number of hits, and the player's number of runs. My script outputs each player's batting average across the 1940 season, which is computed by dividing a player's total hits by player's total number of times at bat.
